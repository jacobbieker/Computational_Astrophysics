# Final Project

This is the final project for the Computational Astrophysics course at Leiden University. 

# Running The Code

To run the code, type ```python main.py [OPTIONS]``` This will start a simulation of [INSERT THINGY] and produce the plots and animations in the ``results/`` folder.

# Setup of Code

This code is organized into the following. The ```main.py``` file takes the command line arguments and runs the simulation for the specified parameters.
The ```libraries/``` folder holds Python files that are called by ```main.py```. The ```results/``` folder holds the output from the simulation.
